<h1>Owen's favourite TV shows</h1>
<h2>My top 3 TV shows of all different genres in no particular order</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Breaking Bad</h3>
<p>This is my favourite 'drama' show; the acting in the show is excellent,
   the tension built up by the different camera angles is perfect and 
   it demonstrates the transition from a 'good guy' to a villian based on terrible circumstances
   which make him break 'bad' essentially.
</p>
<h3>The Office</h3>
<p>A classic comedic sitcom, which never fails to make me laugh.
    The Office is my goto show when I can't find something good to watch 
    while I'm eating. 
    <br />10/10.
</p>
<h3>Mr Robot</h3>
<p>A show that reveals the evil aspect of top corporations that you see everyday.
    Mr Robot is about a hacking group called 'FSociety' who attempt to make the corporations
    that essentially run the world pay for their terrible acts. I will not reveal too much about the show,
    all I will say is, watch it. 
    <br />9/10.
